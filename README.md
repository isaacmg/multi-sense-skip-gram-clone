# multi-sense-skip-gram-clone
An attempt to get the code of the Multi Sense Skip Gram model from the article "Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space" up to date and (hopefully) refactored so that it's to integrate into Scala/Java data pipelines. Original code taken from jeevan_shankar's bitbucket.
